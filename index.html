            <h3>Bangkok, the city of angels</h3>
            <p>
              Bangkok is officially referred to as Krung Thep; its literal
              meaning in the language is "City of Angels." The full ceremonial
              name of this city is recognised as one of the longest place names
              in the world, comprising 169 characters. The term "angels" is a
              word that represents guardian deities believed to guard the city
              and its people. Such an attractive title comprehends Bangkok's
              attractions, best captured in its lively atmosphere, markets,
              amazing temples, and hospitality, a favourite destination worthy
              of its heavenly name.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bangkok is a city that brings together ancient culture with
              modernity. Large roads are full of excitement, lined with vibrant
              markets, ornate temples, and breathtaking street food that will
              leave the hearts of all travellers in the world. The history,
              architecture, lively nightlife and shopping bazaar continue to
              thrive within it. It can be a visit to the Grand Grand Palace or,
              more likely, a boat trip along the Chao Phraya River. Bangkok
              promises unforgettable adventures that are sure to leave you
              enchanted.
